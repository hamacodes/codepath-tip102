Problem 6: Find Next Order to Fulfill Today

Understand:
- We have a binary tree where each node represents an order.
- Each level represents a different day's orders.
- Given a node `order`, we need to find the next node to fulfill on the same level.
- If `order` is the last node on its level (rightmost node), return None.

Plan:
- Perform a level-order traversal (BFS) to keep track of nodes at each level.
- While traversing, compare each node with the target `order`.
- When we find the target, the next node in the queue (if it's on the same level) is the next order.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
- Space Complexity: O(n), due to the queue used for BFS.

Problem 6: Sectioning Off Cursed Zones

Understand:
- Given a binary tree `hotel`, where nodes represent rooms.
- Need to find the smallest subtree that contains all the deepest nodes.
- Deepest nodes are those with the maximum depth.
- Return the root of the smallest subtree containing all deepest nodes.

Plan:
- Use recursion to find the depth of each node.
- For each node, keep track of:
  - Its depth.
  - If its left and right subtrees contain the deepest nodes.
- The current node is the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) of deepest nodes if left and right depths are equal and maximum.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
- Space Complexity: O(h), due to recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree.
